## Metadata

```yaml
plan_id: "04-01"
phase: 4
title: "Installation Steps with Timeline Animation"
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified:
  - src/components/installation-section.tsx (create)
  - src/app/page.tsx (update)

  - INST-02  # Active step has beating dot animation in espresso color
  - INST-03  # Liquid flow animation down timeline as steps complete
  - INST-04  # Grey/muted upcoming steps

autonomous: true
estimated_duration: "8 min"
```

## Context

Build the installation steps section that shows users how easy BrewClaw is to set up. Uses GSAP ScrollTrigger for scroll-based step progression and a vertical timeline with liquid flow effect.

### Design Reference
- clawi.ai style with liquid flow + beating dot
- Light background section (contrast with dark hero)
- 3 steps: Create Config → Deploy → Use (per PRD)

## must_haves

- [ ] Section has light/cream background (#FAFAF9 or similar)
- [ ] 3 installation steps displayed vertically with connecting timeline
- [ ] Active step has beating dot animation in espresso color (#78350F)
- [ ] Upcoming steps are grey/muted
- [ ] Liquid flow animation progresses down timeline on scroll
- [ ] Video placeholder (or demo video if available) syncs with step progression
- [ ] GSAP ScrollTrigger controls step progression based on scroll position

## Tasks

<task id="1" type="create">
<title>Create Installation Section Component</title>
<file>src/components/installation-section.tsx</file>
<details>
Create a new component with:
- "use client" directive (GSAP requires client)
- Import gsap, ScrollTrigger, useGSAP from @/lib/gsap-config
- 3 steps data: Create Config, Deploy, Use
- Vertical timeline with connecting line
- Beating dot indicator for active step (CSS animation in espresso color)
- Step content cards with title and description
- Video placeholder on right side (or actual video if available)
- useGSAP hook for scroll-triggered animations:
  - Pin the section during scroll
  - Progress through steps as user scrolls
  - Liquid flow effect (gradient moving down timeline)
  - Fade in each step when it becomes active
</details>
</task>

<task id="2" type="update">
<title>Add Beating Dot Animation</title>
<file>src/app/globals.css</file>
<details>
Add CSS keyframes for beating dot:
- @keyframes beat { ... } - scale pulse effect
- .beating-dot class with animation
- Use espresso color (#78350F) for active dot
- Muted color for inactive dots
</details>
</task>

<task id="3" type="update">
<title>Add Installation Section to Page</title>
<file>src/app/page.tsx</file>
<details>
Import InstallationSection component and add it after HeroSection.
Section should have id="installation" for potential nav linking.
</details>
</task>

## Verification

```bash
# Dev server should be running
npm run dev
```

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Scroll past hero section
3. Verify installation section appears with light background
4. Verify 3 steps are displayed vertically
5. Verify beating dot animation on active step (espresso color)
6. Verify inactive steps are grey/muted
7. Verify scroll triggers step progression
8. Verify video placeholder is visible

## Notes

- Use GSAP for scroll animations per Phase 1 decision
- Steps content from PRD: Create Config, Deploy, Use
- Liquid flow is optional enhancement - solid progress line acceptable for MVP
