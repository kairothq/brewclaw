# Plan: Comparison Section with Coffee Brewing

## Metadata

```yaml
plan_id: "04-02"
phase: 4
title: "Comparison Section with Coffee Brewing"
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified:
  - src/components/comparison-section.tsx (create)
  - src/app/page.tsx (update)
requirements:
  - COMP-01  # Two-column comparison layout
  - COMP-02  # Traditional Method (left) shows itemized breakdown (60 min total)
  - COMP-03  # BrewClaw (right) shows coffee brewing animation
  - COMP-04  # Fade-in on scroll via GSAP ScrollTrigger
autonomous: true
estimated_duration: "6 min"
```

## Context

Build the comparison section that contrasts the traditional 60-minute setup process with BrewClaw's "coffee brewing time" simplicity. This is a key value proposition visualizer.

### Design Reference
- Premium template style with scroll fade
- Dark background (contrast with light installation section)
- Two columns: Traditional (boring list) vs BrewClaw (engaging animation)

## must_haves

- [ ] Two-column layout (responsive to stacked on mobile)
- [ ] Left column: "Traditional Method" with itemized time breakdown totaling 60 minutes
- [ ] Right column: "With BrewClaw" showing coffee emoji and "Time to brew coffee" messaging
- [ ] Coffee brewing animation (steam rising, cup filling, or similar)
- [ ] GSAP ScrollTrigger fade-in animation for entire section
- [ ] Dark background section

## Tasks

<task id="1" type="create">
<title>Create Comparison Section Component</title>
<file>src/components/comparison-section.tsx</file>
<details>
Create a new component with:
- "use client" directive (GSAP requires client)
- Import gsap, ScrollTrigger, useGSAP from @/lib/gsap-config
- Two-column grid layout (md:grid-cols-2)
- Left column "Traditional Method":
  - Header with clock icon
  - List of setup tasks with times:
    - Server setup: 15 min
    - Database configuration: 10 min
    - Authentication setup: 10 min
    - API integration: 15 min
    - Testing & debugging: 10 min
    - Total: 60 minutes (highlighted in red/warning color)
  - Styled as boring/tedious (grey tones, strikethrough effect)
- Right column "With BrewClaw":
  - Coffee emoji (large, centered)
  - "Time to brew a coffee" text
  - Steam animation using CSS or Motion
  - Styled as fun/inviting (coffee/amber accents)
- useGSAP hook for scroll-triggered fade-in:
  - Fade in from below when section enters viewport
  - Stagger left and right columns
</details>
</task>

<task id="2" type="update">
<title>Add Comparison Section to Page</title>
<file>src/app/page.tsx</file>
<details>
Import ComparisonSection component and add it after InstallationSection.
Section should have id="comparison" for potential nav linking.
Dark background (#0A0A0A or similar).
</details>
</task>

## Verification

```bash
# Dev server should be running
npm run dev
```

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Scroll to comparison section
3. Verify two-column layout displays correctly
4. Verify left column shows 60-minute breakdown
5. Verify right column shows coffee brewing theme
6. Verify fade-in animation triggers on scroll
7. Verify responsive stacking on mobile viewport

## Notes

- Coffee animation can be simple CSS keyframes (steam effect)
- Motion can be used for coffee cup animation (component animation per Phase 1 decision)
- GSAP ScrollTrigger handles the scroll-based reveal
